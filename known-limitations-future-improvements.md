# Known Limitations and Future Improvements

This document outlines current limitations of the Stateflow platform and planned improvements for future releases.

## Current Limitations

### 1. Collaboration System

#### Conflict Resolution
**Issue**: The current collaboration system uses a **last-write-wins** strategy with full HTML content synchronization. When two users edit simultaneously, one user's changes may overwrite another's.

**Impact**: 
- Low to medium impact for small teams
- Higher impact with many concurrent editors
- Potential loss of edits during rapid simultaneous changes

**Current Workaround**: 
- Users are notified when remote updates are applied
- Conflict indicator flashes when updates arrive
- Users can manually save to persist their changes

#### Operational Transforms / CRDTs
**Issue**: YJS and related CRDT libraries are installed but not actively used. The system broadcasts full HTML content instead of operational transforms.

**Impact**: 
- Higher bandwidth usage
- Less efficient for large documents
- No true conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) benefits

**Current Implementation**: 
- Socket.IO-based HTML content broadcasting
- Simple update filtering by socket ID to prevent loops

#### Scalability
**Issue**: The current collaboration architecture broadcasts updates to all users in a page room without rate limiting or queuing.

**Impact**:
- May struggle with 10+ concurrent editors
- High-frequency updates could overwhelm clients
- No message prioritization

### 2. Editor Features

#### Offline Support
**Issue**: No offline editing capability. Changes are lost if network connection is lost before saving.

**Impact**: 
- Work interruption when internet is unstable
- No ability to work while offline

**Current State**: 
- Changes must be saved while online
- Auto-save requires active connection

#### Version History
**Issue**: Limited version history. Basic versioning exists but lacks:
- Granular change tracking
- Diff visualization
- Rollback capabilities
- Branch/merge functionality

**Impact**: 
- Difficult to track document evolution
- Hard to recover from accidental deletions
- No collaboration conflict history

#### Large Document Performance
**Issue**: Editor may slow down with very large documents (10,000+ words, many images, complex tables).

**Impact**: 
- Laggy typing experience
- Slow rendering
- High memory usage

**Current State**: 
- Works well for typical documents (few hundred to few thousand words)
- Performance degrades with very complex content

#### Image Handling
**Issue**: 
- Images are embedded as base64 or URLs
- No image optimization or compression
- Large images can slow down the editor
- No image upload service integration

**Impact**: 
- Slow loading times
- High bandwidth usage
- Storage limitations for base64 images

### 3. AI Features

#### AI Autocomplete
**Issue**: AI autocomplete is experimental and may have:
- Inconsistent suggestion quality
- Rate limiting issues
- Higher latency

**Impact**: 
- May not always provide useful suggestions
- Could slow down typing experience

**Current State**: 
- Can be enabled/disabled per editor instance
- Uses Google Gemini API

#### AI Cost Management
**Issue**: No usage tracking or rate limiting for AI features.

**Impact**: 
- Potential high API costs with heavy usage
- No user-level quotas
- No analytics on AI usage

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

#### Session Management
**Issue**: 
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerability)
- No token refresh mechanism
- Sessions expire after fixed time

**Impact**: 
- Security concerns with localStorage
- Users must re-authenticate after token expiration
- No "remember me" functionality

**Current State**: 
- JWT tokens in localStorage
- Cookie-based sessions for Passport.js
- Fixed expiration times

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Issue**: Basic RBAC exists but lacks:
- Granular permissions
- Permission inheritance
- Custom roles
- Resource-level permissions

**Impact**: 
- Limited flexibility for complex permission scenarios
- May need to add roles for specific use cases

### 5. Data Management

#### Search Functionality
**Issue**: Basic search exists but may lack:
- Full-text search indexing
- Advanced search filters
- Search result ranking
- Search across all workspace content

**Impact**: 
- May be slow for large workspaces
- Limited search capabilities

#### Data Export
**Issue**: No bulk export functionality for:
- Workspace data
- Pages and content
- Task lists
- User data

**Impact**: 
- Difficult to backup data
- No data portability
- Hard to migrate to other systems

#### Database Migrations
**Issue**: No formal migration system for schema changes.

**Impact**: 
- Manual database updates required
- Risk of data inconsistency during updates
- No version control for database schema

### 6. User Experience

#### Mobile Responsiveness
**Issue**: Editor may not be fully optimized for mobile devices:
- Touch interactions may be limited
- Toolbar may not be mobile-friendly
- Collaboration features may not work well on mobile

**Impact**: 
- Poor mobile editing experience
- Limited functionality on tablets/phones

#### Accessibility
**Issue**: Limited accessibility features:
- Keyboard navigation may be incomplete
- Screen reader support may be limited
- ARIA labels may be missing

**Impact**: 
- Difficult for users with disabilities
- Not compliant with WCAG guidelines

#### Internationalization (i18n)
**Issue**: No multi-language support:
- UI is English-only
- No RTL language support
- Content must be in supported languages

**Impact**: 
- Limited global usability
- Cannot serve non-English speaking users

### 7. Performance

#### Initial Load Time
**Issue**: First load may be slow due to:
- Large bundle sizes
- No code splitting optimization
- All dependencies loaded upfront

**Impact**: 
- Slow initial page load
- Poor experience on slow connections

#### Real-time Updates
**Issue**: No batching or throttling of real-time updates:
- Each keystroke may trigger network requests
- High update frequency can overwhelm clients

**Impact**: 
- High bandwidth usage
- Potential performance issues with many collaborators
